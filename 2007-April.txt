Subject: [OpenDX2-dev] Problems with using DXlite on Windows
Message-ID: <200704031654.47139.grivna@pangea.ru>

Hello,

I was using DX data model some years on Linux/Solaris (DXlite library). Now I 
have to port one application on WIndows. I installed OpenDX from setup and 
trying to compile my application with MSVC2003 C++ compiler.

I've got a link error - cannot find _imp__lperror function. Is this problem 
known? Can you very kindly help me?

Best regards,
Igor Grivko
